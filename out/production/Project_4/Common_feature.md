Common Features
While the specifics of each implementation will be related to the option you select, there are two common features for every project. 

Roles
There will be two defined roles in the application: Teacher and Student.
Teachers will be able to create courses and edit content within them.

Permissions details will be noted in the option requirements. 

Courses
